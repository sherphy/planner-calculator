scrolling is internal only. dont change the overall webpage
grid-flex also wtf is going on for that

-- sort inventory (by classname?) --
-- if sets somehow bundle together (make same class and give css for that class?)--
-- delete items from inventory (in Cards onClick) => ESP SETS --

DELETE ITEMS must delete whole sets
-- now currently delete one item means delete that item universally --
ISSUE: deletion sometimes adds? 
if same item name, the card previously clicked will be the one that deletes the item instead
